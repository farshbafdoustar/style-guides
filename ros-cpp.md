# Naming Conventions

The following shortcuts are used in this section to denote naming schemes:
- CamelCased: The name starts with a capital letter, and has a capital letter for each new word, with no underscores.
- camelCased: Like CamelCase, but with a lower-case first letter
- under_scored: The name uses only lower-case letters, with words separated by underscores. (yes, I realize that under_scored should be underscored, because it's just one word).
- ALL_CAPITALS: All capital letters, with words separated by underscores.
